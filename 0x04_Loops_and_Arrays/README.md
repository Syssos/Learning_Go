# For loops and Arrays

## Overview
In this directory we will see how we can use for loops and arrays to our advantage. For loops themselfs can be a simple concept, however depending on how there used they can be an incrediably powerful asset to the code you are writing. They are tasked to do the same chunk of code, until the condition is no longer true.

Unlike if statements there is no code that runs if the condition is false, so if a counter is not reset, or is out of place before a loop is ran, it can cause it to run incorrectly, if at all.

Arrays are also very useful. They group together chunks of data under one variable name, this could be a list a names, or maybe a list of credit card numbers. In this directory we will see how we can use them, and share them with other parts of our code.
