# Slices

## Overview

Slices in Go are more common to use then array's as slices have no set length. Although they work in a very similar fasion arrays and slices work in different manors. The Go compiler will take an array name, length, and an optional capacity when creating the array, and then return a slice for us to work with.

Sense a slice is easier to work with we will use them more in the code we write. This directory will cover using a slice, adding, and removing items, as well as accessing specific locations within a slice. The examples above will be critical to understanding what the description is talking about, so be sure to take a look at the example before/or after reading the description to get a clear picture of whats being discussed.

## 00_Slices
As explained above slices work in similar ways to an array. This example will cover declaring and printing a slice.

We can see that when declaring the slice we use the array arr, that is because the slice we are creating will use that array. If we created the slice without using the parrent array we would have to manually reassign the values into it.
