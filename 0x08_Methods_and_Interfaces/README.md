# Methods and Interfaces

## Overview



## 00_Methods

This example shows how methods are created and used. While the example is just printing the name of the variable in a preset string, it demenstrates what a method would be used for.

Methods are designed to easily use the same function with any instance of a struct. This example shows that both "new_car", and "another_one" could use the function "print_name" via dot notation.

You can think of methods in a similar way to the "name" variable, as every car will have a ".name", they will also have a ".print_name()". A use case example of when a method could be useful is hashing a password before saving, or calling an api to get rating data.
