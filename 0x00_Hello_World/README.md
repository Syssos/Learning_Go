The goal here is to have a solid understanding of printing data to the screen before movinbg on. This is because printing data to the screen(or the "standard output") is one of the most important features in most programming langauges. We will use print functions all over the place, and can they be your best friend while debugging issues in more complex scripts.

Okay so we have an idea of what we want our code to do,  but how do we get started? Well lets start at the top of the page and work our way down.

Okay so hopefully you read the README, or the enviornment settup section of the README in the parent directory to this one. In that section I mention setting up a module
