# If Else

## Introduction
In this directory we will talk about a very useful built in, in Go. That is the if statement. As you will learn the word "if" is extremly powerful in go. It is a way for developers to control the flow of there code. It will be how most error handling is done, as it can be a tool to tell developers when certain conditions are not met. With this tool in your toolbelt your code will take a huge leap in functionality so make sure you understand these statements before moving on.

## 03_Recap
This recap highlights some very important concepts we covered in the last few directories, These are the absolute basics of the Go programming language. It's very likely that a majority of the topics discused will be used in every script, or program you write in the future. Hopefully that outlines the importances of knowing these concepts. There is a large amount of online resources that can help you if there is anything I didn't explain in enough detail. I recommend spending some time writing scripts like this example if you are still a little fuzzy on the topic. Google each error message and over time the messages will start to make sense as you learn what the code is doing in the background.
