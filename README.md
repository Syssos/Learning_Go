# Learning Go
### The tasks I used to learn the basics
Go is an extremely powerful langauge to have in your toolbelt as a developer on any level. It has a bunch of packages built in that can be utilized and its goal is to create lightweight executables without the hastle of other lower level langanges. It deals with memory management (which coming from C is a very nice touch), and will hold you responsible for imports or variables that are declared and never used.

I could turn this readme into a list with all the reasons Go is a good langauge to learn, but for the sake of time and to get back to learning I'll just move along. In the following directories are Go scripts, grouped together by category, I used to learn the langauge. Alongside anther readme describing the point of each script.

### 0x00_Hello_World
This Directory is dedicated to learning the basics of Go. I Learned how to run and build the code as well as the basic syntax and file structure. I also looked into printing strings to the standard output as this will be used to show everything we are doing as we learn and progress.

### 0x01_Variables
This Directory is all about varibales and datypes in Go. There are a few that are different from C that I would like to highlight, as well as cover the basics of how go handles common datatypes.
