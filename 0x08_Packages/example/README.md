# 00_Package

## Overview

The reason this example is a directory is because of how packages are structured within the project. Think of a project as an "add-on", and this folder as its home. While the name of the file containing our package is named pretty print, keep in mind that it does not have to be the name of the project, so while it is named pretty_print the package name is "example".
