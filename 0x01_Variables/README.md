### Dataype Time
Quick overview:
	This directory is deticated to dataypes, below I will outline the dataypes used in the files above.

## Data Types:

| Dataype |  							Description						|
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| String | A string is a representation of a collection of Letters and Numbers. 
			Some examples include "Bobby", "ASDFUIAHE", "Happy Birthday Tony". 
			They are most often denoted with quotes, and in Go they can be 
			represented by the word "string" like in the function "Greet_user(F string, L string)" from 
			the previous section.|
| Int    | Int stands for Integar. It is the dataype that represents whole 
			numbers. The reason I say whole numbers is because an int can 
			only be a whole number, there is a completly different datatype 
			for numbers with a decimal point. For example "1024"|
| FLoat  | A float is the datatype that represents numbers with a decimal point. For example "3.14" |
