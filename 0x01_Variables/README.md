### Dataype Time
Quick overview:
	This directory is dedicated to datatypes, below I will outline the datatypes used in the files above. In the table I will give a brief overview of the general datatypes that appear to be present in most programming langauges, however because Go is compiled we have some more flexability then say python when it comes to saving/or storing data. This means that Go will require a little more in-depth knowledge about these dataypes, and we will go over those specifics as we get to them in the examples.

## Data Types:

| Dataype   | Description |
| :-:       | :---        |
| "String"  | A string is a representation of a collection of Letters and Numbers. Some examples include "Bobby", "ASDFUIAHE", "Happy Birthday Tony". They are most often denoted with quotes,  and in Go they can berepresented by the word "string". |
| "Int"     | Int stands for Integar. It is the dataype that represents whole	numbers. The reason I say whole numbers is because an int can only be a whole number, there is a completly different datatype for numbers with a decimal point. For example "1024" |   
| "Float"   | A float is the datatype that represents numbers with a decimal point. For example "3.14" |
| "Boolean" | A Boolean is the representation of True or False. The Boolean datatype will consist of those 2 predefined constants |
