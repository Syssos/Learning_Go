# Benchmarks

Within this file will be benchmarks for all the examples found in the [0x11_Concurrency](https://github.com/Syssos/Learning_Go/tree/main/0x11_Concurrency) directory. The purpose of these test's are to demenstrate real life applications to what is covered, as well as act as a guidance to for when were and how using different approaches can beinift or harm the overall program.

Here you will see the difference in performance over various approaches to completing a task. As well as how you can benchmark your own projects to test for various speeds throughout your program. 

Primarily these tests are going to be targeted around the speed the program, however additional aspects will be taken into consideration when reviewing the results.
