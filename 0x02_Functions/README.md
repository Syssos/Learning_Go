# Functions

## Importance

When making more complex programs, repeating tasks, or large chunks of code can be a common accurance. Meaning a method of easily re-using code can be vital to a programs readablity, keeping it as easy for the developer to follow along as can be.

This is where functions come in, this directory will cover the basics of functions, and some **import**ant uses of them.

## 00_Functions

In this example we look at declaring, and calling a function. We declare a function by using the Go keyword "func".

The words following func is the name of the function, it is how we will refrence it in our code. The Paranthese that follows the name of are function are required by go, it is essentually a list of arguments the function will take. If our function takes no arguments then we need to specify that by leaving it blank.
